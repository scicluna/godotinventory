# What to do?

- Announcement System
    - Canvas
    - Easy Methods to Hook into or Call an Announcement
    - Easy Method to Call for a sound clip to acompany the announcement
        - Can use for achievements and announcements alike aswell as level ups and skill ups

- Loot Boxes
    - Randomization Graphics and item flying out of a box
    - Figure out how to access from inventory
    - Shit like that. Idk. Its a bit hazy in my mind

- Acheivment System
    - Track various stats for the game in some sort of acheivment-centered key value system
        - Call to update ahcievment stats with something like update_achievements("key", value)
        - Then check to see if any acheivements were made by quickly moving over the key value pairs and determining through a case statement if any were met and awarding to the inventory and making an announcement upon meeting them.
