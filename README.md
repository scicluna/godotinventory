# What to do?

- Announcement System
	- Canvas
	- Easy Methods to Hook into or Call an Announcement
	- Easy Method to Call for a sound clip to acompany the announcement
		- Can use for achievements and announcements alike aswell as level ups and skill ups

- Loot Boxes
	- Randomization Graphics and item flying out of a box
	- Figure out how to access from inventory
	- Shit like that. Idk. Its a bit hazy in my mind

- Acheivment System
	- Track various stats for the game in some sort of acheivment-centered key value system
		- Call to update ahcievment stats with something like update_achievements("key", value)
		- Then check to see if any acheivements were made by quickly moving over the key value pairs and determining through a case statement if any were met and awarding to the inventory and making an announcement upon meeting them.

- no time today
